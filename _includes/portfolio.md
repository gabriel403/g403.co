Most of my open source code can be viewed in my github account, these include full modules for ZF2 [DB Sessions](https://github.com/gabriel403/G403SessionDb) [PHP Based CI Server](https://github.com/Block8/PHPCI), doing bug fixes and code for ZF2 itself, as well as working on my projects to try out the various other programming languages out there, including a kanban board written in Node.js [Kaizen Kanban](https://github.com/gabriel403/KaizenKanban), using redis as a backend.
