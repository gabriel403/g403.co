Most of my open source code can be viewed in my github account, these include a set of tools for generating API end points [Slim API](https://github.com/slimphp-api), modules for the Slim PHP framework, modules for ZF2, [PHP Based CI Server](https://github.com/Block8/PHPCI), doing bug fixes and code for Slim & ZF2 itself, as well as working on my projects to try out the various other programming languages. A RoR app for doing deployments [Prowl](https://github.com/gabriel403/Prowl), [v2](https://github.com/prowl-deployment). A kanban board written in Node.js [Kaizen Kanban](https://github.com/gabriel403/KaizenKanban), using redis as a backend.
