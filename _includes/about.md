Welcome to G403.co, my name is Gabriel and I will be your host for this journey into insanity.

I currently work at [Mindera](https://mindera.com/) as a developer, working across various projects. Currently working on the [Dunelm](https://www.dunelm.com/) project as a nodejs backend developer, with lots of AWS infra and lambda fun. I've previously worked on [Jam Pan](https://www.jam-pan.com/) as a React developer, producing their system for connecting creative suppliers with clients wanting to hire them. Prior to this I was working as a BE Go developer for the [Mitek](https://www.miteksystems.com/) project.

Previously I was a system's developer for [Fusions](https://fusionspim.com), producing code, maintaining systems and developing automation techniques (think [puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/), [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), [jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) and [packer](http://www.packer.io/)) to streamline development, deployment and maintenace.

I am formerly a dev-op for [Go MAD Thinking](http://www.gomadthinking.com/), where I developed software as well maintained infrastructure.

I had previously suffered quite badly from chronic side project syndrome (CSPS), producing tonnes of projects no-one used :grin:. [Slim API](https://github.com/slimphp-api), a set of command line tools for generating API endpoints/mvc architecture on top of Slim using Symfony's console component. I helped where I could with maintenance on the [Slim PHP](https://github.com/slimphp) framework. I also built [DOM](https://github.com/gabriel403/do-manager), a front end for working with Digital Ocean's v2 API, though with the new team functionality in DO it's not needed so much.

I had also produced an open source deployment platform built using [Rails-API](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api) and a front end client in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)/[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

Through Fusions I had maintained 3 modules for [hubot](), [hubot-dploy.io](https://github.com/fusionspim/hubot-dploy.io), [hubot-automerger](https://github.com/fusionspim/hubot-automerger) and [hubot-trello-list-alerts](https://github.com/fusionspim/hubot-trello-list-alerts).

I also contribute to [various](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2) [open](https://github.com/Block8/PHPCI) [source](https://github.com/bjyoungblood/BjyAuthorize) projects in my spare time, mainly focused on PHP. I had written my own [markdown website handler](https://github.com/gabriel403/autonomicpilot.co.uk) but now I use [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

My work projects have consisted of [Fusions](https://fusionspim.com), <s>D&A Opticians</s>, [iCheev](http://www.icheev.com) and I was lead developer on the corporate administration site for iCheev.

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/gabriel403), [github](https://github.com/gabriel403), [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/gabriel403), [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/499332/gabriel-baker). If you see the username gabriel403 somewhere, it's probably me.

My main languages are currently NodeJS/TS, with previous heavy experience in PHP/RoR with oodles of jQuery, AngularJS, Bootstrap and Dojo JS as well.

I'm a graduate of De Montfort University, gaining a 1st class degree with Honours in Software Engineering.
